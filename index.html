    <p>As an artist, I have something to say.</p>
    <p>As a man, I have much that must be done.</p>
    <p>As a human, I am as ashamed as I am proud.</p>
    <p>As a professional, I was too censored.</p>
    <p>As a Canadian, I am only closer to freedom than some.</p>
    <p>Our world isn't as good as it should be.</p>
    <p>This is what response I am required to give in order to conduct myself as I must.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p>Those who appeal to anything but the mind shattering acceptance of ambiguity, are cowards. Thieves, murdering in the shadows of our unborn futures.</p>
    <p>A <em>they</em> who is not morally or rationally capable of being judged independently of ourselves, failed.
    <p>Cursed by the clergy who count our coins, the multinational interests who authorize our authoritarians, and the liars who conspire for their own desires.</p>
    <p>Implicit incentives and false binaries bar our doors, but merely paper over our windows.</p>
    <p>So I will give what I am confident I can compress to any who may make use of it.</p>
    <p>I will do my best, and I will keep faith for all the rest.</p>
    <p>Canada, is as near as makes no difference to my practical responsibilities, irredeemably stricken by regulatory capture.</p>
	<p>Droves of demoniacs demanding dereliction or death.</p>
    <p>So to their hells with them all. I refuse to be small. I will stand tall.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>How?</h1>
    <p>Overwhelming victory, on every front, all at once. By the power of people.</p>
    <p>We all, do our work.</p>
    <p>Thanks be to God that we are capable.</p>
    <p>There is no defeating Evil. There is only a shining of the light, and a willingness to survive the fight.</p>
    <p>Hope is for the humans who help.</p>
    <p>To hell with everything in everyone's way.</p>
    <p>Trust me, or don't.</p>
    <p>I'll be me. And we'll fucking see.</p>
