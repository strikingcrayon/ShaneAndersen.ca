    <p>As an artist, I have something to say.</p>
    <p>As a man, I have much that must be done.</p>
    <p>As a human, I am as ashamed as I am proud.</p>
    <p>As a professional, I was censored.</p>
    <p>As a Canadian, I am only closer to freedom than some.</p>
    <p>Our world isn't as good as it should be.</p>
    <p>This is what response I am required to give in order to conduct myself as I must.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1>Why?</h1>
    <p>Those who appeal to anything but the mind shattering acceptance of ambiguity, are cowards. Thieves, murdering in the shadows of our unborn futures.</p>
    <p>The collective evil of history weighs on us like the inertia of an eternity. Our opportunity to feel it, a function of our ability to remedy it.</p>
    <p>A <em>they</em> who is not morally or rationally capable of being judged independently of judging ourselves, failed us all. Leaving us with an ambiguous authority lacking a mandate; divine, democratic, or even directed.</p>
    <p>We have become cursed by the clergy who count our coins, the multinational interests who authorize our authoritarians, and the liars who conspire for their own desires. Implicit incentives and false binaries lock our doors, but merely papered over our windows. Monetary hegemony, a self-wielding weapon, is nearly all that is in control. So I will give what I am confident I can compress to any who may make use of it. I will do my best, and I will keep faith for all the rest.</p>
    <p>Canada, is as near as makes no difference to my practical responsibilities, irredeemably stricken by regulatory capture.</p>
    <p>Demons demanding derelection or death. So to their hell with them all. I refuse, to be small. I will stand tall.</p>

    <h1>How?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Life is an emergent property which cooperates.</li>
        <li>Language is compression, artifacts are inherent.</li>
        <li>Reality is probabilistic; Determinism is dead.</li>
        <li>Time and trust are the only natural resources.</li>
        <li>There are no solutions, only trade-offs.</li>
        <li>Diversification must include (De)Globalization.</li>
        <li>Rationalizing is a reflex despite rationality being a skill.</li>
        <li>Judgement is impossible, yet discernment is required.</li>
        <li>There are fates worse than death.</li>
        <li>Reality regresses to a norm.</li>
        <li>Asymmetric ethics are a fact of freedom.</li>
        <li>Freedom is responsibility incarnated.</li>
        <li>You cannot collapse a field to a point to use mathematics as a lever upon society without falling to the will and ill of a central planning agenda.</li>
        <li>Money is incapable of being a primary denominator.</li>
        <li>Individual > Collective</li>
        <li>Renewal > Revolution</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>Thanks be to God that we are capable. For we must all do our work. As responsibility is as infinite as freedom.</p>
    <p>There is no defeating evil. There is only a shining of the light, and a willingness to survive the fight.</p>
    <p>Hope is for the humans who help.</p>
    <p>To hell with everything in everyone's way.</p>
    <p>Trust me, or don't.</p>
    <p>I'll be me. And we'll fucking see.</p>
